This theme comes with the [@astrojs/mdx](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/) integration installed and configured in your `astro.config.mjs` config file. If you prefer not to use MDX, you can disable support by removing the integration from your config file.

## Why MDX?

MDX is a special flavor of Markdown that supports embedded JavaScript & JSX syntax. This unlocks the ability to [mix JavaScript and UI Components into your Markdown content](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#mdx-features) for things like interactive charts or alerts.

If you have existing content authored in MDX, this integration will hopefully make migrating to Astro a breeze.

## Example

Here is how you import and use a UI component inside of MDX.  
When you open this page in the browser, you should see the clickable button below.

import HeaderLink from '../../components/HeaderLink.astro';

<HeaderLink href="/" onclick="alert('clicked!')">
	Embedded component in MDX
</HeaderLink>


## Syntax Highlighting

MDX also supports syntax highlighting for code blocks.


```jsx title="MyComponent.jsx"  {1,2,3}
import React from 'react';


export default function MyComponent() {
	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
		</div>
	);
}
// Lifecycle methods are not supported in Astro
```

```bash title="skeleton"
go build [-o output] [build flags] [packages]
```

```js ins={1,3,5} del={2,4}
  console.log('Hello World')
  console.log('Hello World')
  console.log('Hello World')
  console.log('Hello World')
  console.log('Hello World')
```
